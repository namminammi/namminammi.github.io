Look, here is another famous one. Ara said pointing at a gigantic canvas.

I don't like it. It doesn't say anything to me.

Really? Come on, it's green, it's blue, and has naked people on it, and they are dancing. What is there not to like?

Still his reaction was quite blunt, even hostile, unlike his usual easygoing manners. They liked quite many things in common, despite their disparate backgrounds from different continents and economic status.

He couldn't appreciate the rough lines and movement that huge artwork was about. Unpolished things just didn't appeal to his fine sensitivity. Copper scented red earth, never ridden by any kind of shoes or wheels. A wild stream gushing off of a cliff without any safety barrier to prevent accidents. Where a primitive man would scream without any concern about neighbors calling police to stop him. Drums made out of rough skin with sticky and warm blood still clinging onto it, hit by bones and twigs, not giving a damn about keeping a steady beat or being in tune.

Maybe that's where a refined culture gets stuck after ages of glorious achievements. Only previously certified facts are regarded as something worthwhile as they fit into the old standard, while leaving little space to try outside of proven boundary. After monumental accomplishments whatever attempt to reach the same level seems to be so feeble and ridiculous so the younger generation doesn't even start anything on their own. We got the masters in the past, and indisputably fantastic works made by them. Why would you care to do something that may not work out most of time?
