News module building challenge:

Instruction: 

The "LATEST NEWS" module will be given a fixed height.  For this assignment, when the content of the "LATEST NEWS" module exceeds the container height, we would like to implement functionality to enable the content to be displayed across multiple pages within the "LATEST NEWS" module.  On the first page, there should be a "MORE" button to allow the user to proceed to the second page.  On the second page, there should be "LESS" and "MORE" buttons to allow the user to go backward or forward.  On the last page, there should only be a "LESS" button to allow the user to return to the previous page. 

Please build this module and refer to the design specs as provided.  You may use generic fonts.

Feel free to include any CSS and JavaScript/jQuery code as needed.  If necessary, you may change the HTML markup to suit your needs.
